This is a tool for playing your own radio station using Spotify API's

You can add a weighted listed of your desired playlists.
They are played proportianately to their weight.

You can record your own "ads" that play every `num_songs_to_play` by placing .wav files in the `sample_ads` subdirectory.

To run this you will need to set environemnt variables for spotify API keys.

HAVE FUN!

Note: I worked on this awhile ago so your results may vary
